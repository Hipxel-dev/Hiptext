# Hiptext
Minimalist text editor made with Godot 3.5

added:
ctrl+s to save current file as a txt, using the tab name as the filename. it saves where the executable is. I'll improve this sometime soon, but it seems to be working fine
button left of the minimize that you can hold to drag the window around

planned:
- ~~saving files~~
- opening files
- file save/select dialogue
- moveable window
